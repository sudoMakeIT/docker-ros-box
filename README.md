# docker-ros-box

Dockerized [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) environment with hardware accelerated X11 support based on [ros-lunar-desktop-full](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrf/ros/).

Using this project you will be able to run a complete ROS environment inside a Docker container.

This is very handful for example if your host operating system is *not* debian based.


# Credits

This project is inspired by [docker-browser-ros](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-browser-box), [this blog post from Fabio Rehm](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/11/running-gui-apps-with-docker/) as well as [docker-opengl-mesa](https://github.com/thewtex/docker-opengl-mesa) for the hardware acceleration support.


# Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pierrekilly/docker-ros-box.git
```

2. Initialize your ROS box:
```
./docker-ros-box/init-ros-box.sh [ros_distro] [target]
    ros_distro        The ROS distribution to work with (lunar, kinetic, etc.)
    target            The target directory to deploy the basic setup
```
Building the docker container image can take some time depending on your internet connexion. Please be patient.

Once the initialization is done, your dockerized ROS box is ready.

In the `target` directory you will find 4 files:

- `ros_distro`: This file contains the ROS distribution used in your project. Do not touch this file.
- `src`: Put your ROS project sources in this directory. It is automatically mounted in ~/catkin_ws/src inside the ROS box so you can work there from your host system.
- `go.sh`: Run this script to open a shell in in the container. Automatically starts the container if it's not running.

3. Connect to your ROS box
```
cd [target]
./go.sh
```
